#### Pre-installation

1. Ensure [Node.js  >=6.4](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com) and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) are installed on your system
2. Register Oauth 2 access to the [Imgur API](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient).

    Register for OAuth 2 authorization without a callback URL. You can name your application anything you like and you don't need a callback URL. The important thing is that you get a *client ID*.
